# Tranquilizer Gun
Remade from the ground, here it's the long awaited Tranquilizer Gun plugin! Allowing you to sleep both players and SCPs (Highly configurable).

### What does it do?
This plugin lets you put people to sleep using a pistol randomly found in LCZ & HCZ, one shot uses all your ammo and you will need to shoot SCPs twice to put them to sleep (Everything here is configurable, even the weapon!).

### Installation
As with any EXILED plugin, you must place the TranquilizerGun.dll file inside of your "%appdata%/Roaming/Plugins" folder.

And... obviously include [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED "EXILED").

### Commands
Arguments inside &lt;&gt; are required. [] means it's optional.
| Command | Description | Arguments |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `tg`   | Plugin's main command, sends info. | **protect/toggle/reload/replaceguns/sleep/version/setgun/addgun**|
- Toggle: Toggles all of the plugin's functions.
- Reload: Reloads every configuration variable.
- ReplaceGuns: Forces the replace of all COM15 with "tgun_weapon". (Config variable).
- Protect: Protection against "T-Guns". (Good for administrators!)
- Sleep: Force the sleeping method on someone. (Or everyone...)
- Version: Get plugin's current version.
- Setgun: Sets the "tgun_weapon" variable to "whatever" you have in your hand.
- Addgun: Adds "whatever" you have in your "tgun_weapon" variable to your inventory.

### Configuration
These are the variables that should be added to your 7777-config.yml. Or simply download/copy&paste the [config-file example](https://github.com/ImUrX/TranquilizerGun/blob/master/Examples/7777-config.yml)

### Planned Changes:

- Changing the "sleeping" system. (Mostly waiting for new SCP:SL patch to hit for more dev-tools)
- SCPs Blacklist. (Configurable too)

### That'd be all
Thanks for passing by, have a nice day! :)
